# If you want to run the code please refer to the links below


The program is in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) running in a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)


You can use the below conda environment to make sure all dependencies etc are present.

**_PLEASE NOTE : my repo alone is not enough to get this working as shown, you will need the car simulator and some other files to get it working as shown in the above Presentation Video_**


Clone the Udacity project repo below, download my notebook and run in the same folder 


Udacity default [readme file](https://github.com/john-reilly/Self_Driving_Car_Nano_Degree_Project_3_Behavioral_Cloning/blob/master/Udacitys_README.md), provides an overview and many links 

Udacity Project [repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3), students begin by cloning this repo and that gives them the images, video and sample code to get started.

Udacity environment [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md), a conda environment to ensure the code runs correctly 

Udacity suggested [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/blob/master/writeup_template.md), a suggestion for how the notebook should be presented

Udacity [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view), to explain how it is graded.
